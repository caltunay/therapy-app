there are no speech therapy apps in turkish. 
this is a quickly spun up, simple streamlit app for turkish speaking stroke victims that are struggling with speaking, writing and understanding (usually due to problems around the bit that controls speaking in the brain)
totally copyleft, use it from the link above, take it, adapt it, improve it.  

on demand, 
1. a random word from a list of daily life objects is selected (1000+ object names)
2. an image search is made via unsplash api 
3. an image from search results is displayed
4. object name is translated to turkish
4. user tries writing and/or saying object's name in turkish
5. when needed (hint) letters can be shown one at a time
6. when needed (hint) pronounciation can be called via gtts api


todo: i just learned that people with these problems don't really register what they say and they assume they are making the right noises. so, this might need a quick tweak on listening the user -and doing something, maybe spelling out, maybe slowing down, etc.
